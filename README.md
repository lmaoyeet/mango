# HeyMango
HeyMango! is a project that is designed like cortana or siri, so that you can have a virtual assistant, right in your browser!
# How does it work?
Mango uses a javascript library called Annyang to work with speech recognition, so that you can be brought closer to this program, and have most programs automated for you!

This is an unfinished program, being developed by TheCoffeeAddicts
